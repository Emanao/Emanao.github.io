I finished it! I do not know if I will graduate since it is all so tight but I FINISHED THE FIFTH AND LAST PROJECT of the series of portfolio projects at Flatiron and I cannot feel more happy. 

It was a long way till I got here, lots of highs and lows on the way, frustration and achievement moments, but all these was worth and now I feel proud about how much I learned and achieved and relieved that I could actually make it.

After looking back at my 5 projects I came to realize that the last years of my life was in need of good books, rewards to motivate some family members and bookmark, lists, orders, you name it,  organizers. This last year has brought a lot of joy, anxiety and chaos, the last one specially related to my browser and email management skills. Even when I think that I can deal with both of them pretty well it comes a time in my life that I have opened 100 tabs spread in different windows or I cannot find track of certain orders that are somewhere in my email box surrounded by thousands of other emails. 

My last project is based on the fact that sometimes is hard for me to track my online orders, that's why I thought of an orders center app would be useful. With it an user can add orders, assigned them the order number, add a description, the store, a tracking link if existing and add notes. Notes can be also deleted.

The hardest parts of the project were setting up the environment to interconnect the frontend with the backend properly, working with ES6, understanding react and redux,  client-routing with react and the different flavors of rendering with it and setting up my reducers keeping in mind that they do not need to follow the nested rails structures. All in all, React, redux did blow my mind first and watching the Globetrotter videos to a playback speed 1.5 didnt help to ease the situation. If you have time, watch those videos! They are a great source of knowledge.

Good luck to all of you who are working towards the completion of this course. It is hard, but you can do it!
