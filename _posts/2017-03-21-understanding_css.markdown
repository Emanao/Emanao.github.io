Well, I am happy I got that far. At the beginning I didn't think I would survive the winter with school snow days and kids sicknesses and my determination to learn more and go faster. But I made it! The winter is almost over and my determination remained untouched. 

And now the time has come to update my blog. In my journey of learning, I think of writing blogs as of stepping out of a car in order to enjoy the views after speeding on a highway. And that is how I feel currently. While working on Ruby and GIT made me feel that I found the right pace in learning, when I came to HTML and CSS I was thrilled about how fast I could go. So fast that after a while I kept going back and forth to the CSS code-alongs and video tutorials to refresh and remember all what I had learned. That’s why now this blog assignment comes so handy. It is time to step back, enjoy the view and recollect important information about the key concepts and best practices of CSS.

First of all, what is CSS? CSS is a very powerful language that describes appearance and formatting of a document written in a markup language, such as HTML. Its fundamental feature is the cascade as stressed by its name. When styling pages rules have to be defined that apply styles to elements of a given type. Those styles form a hierarchy in which more specific styles override more general styles. This method is called the cascade.

Next the most important concept in CSS layout is the box model. Learning that everything in web design is a rectangular box and has width, weight, padding, borders and margins helped me to understand the layout principles. Those boxes or elements in web pages can have children which inherit properties from them.
There are two major categories of style properties:
* Formatting properties, which consist of properties that affect the visual display of elements within a website, such as the font type, size, and color.
* Layout properties, which consist of properties that affect the positioning of elements on a web page, such as margins, padding, and alignment.

As a best practice when using the latest web technologies, like HTML5 and CSS3, the use of a reset style sheet is recommended in order to reduce browser inconsistencies, as for example the normalize HTML5 reset stylesheet. 
In oder to take advantage of the new features of HTML5 and CSS3 without sacrificing control over the user experience in other browsers we use modernizr, a feature detection library for HTML5 and CSS3.

Additionally, the need of today’s modern technological era is to have a working design compatible across multiple platforms and devices and that’s why we need to build responsible design web pages. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of media queries.

Frameworks like Bootstrap are feature-packed and have most of the things we need for developing responsive web sites.
