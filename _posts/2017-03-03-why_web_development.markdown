In the late 90s, after completing my academic degree in electronic engineering in Germany, I decided to try my luck to find a job there.
I am not a German native speaker and thought it was a great opportunity to learn a new language while I was working!
At that time, Germany was in need of software developers and I jumped into the field of web development. I am not a techie person but I always liked technology and challenges. So I tried and loved it. 
It was hard but I still don’t know what was harder to learn: Java, HTML, JavaScript, Sql… or German from scratch. Point is that after finding the balance between language and programming skills I always felt I never had the time to dive into so many topics I was confronted on daily basis… 
Long story short. I moved to the US because of my husband’s job and after a long break and always with the desire to go back to work in the same field I found the Web Development program at Flatiron School. And I am thrilled! I love the program’s structure, the community and the resources that we have access to. While I am sometimes frustrated because I don't progress as fast as I would like to, I enjoy every single step because I have the time. 
There is so much to learn in these days, where the resources are so easily accessible in the internet to everyone! Reading books online, watching video tutorials, finding forums… Just exciting.
I know this is not going to last too long, at some point, when I am ready, I will need to get my hands dirty in some own/corporate projects and time will be once again a nice to have feature. 
Till then, cheers!
