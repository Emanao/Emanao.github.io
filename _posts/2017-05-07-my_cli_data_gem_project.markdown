Finally I finished my first assignment and I still feel that I could have spent much longer with it. But since I know that I still have 4 more projects to go and a lot of more lessons, I will stop here.
The most challenging part of all was, as always, the beginning. What to scrape? Once I solved this, I decided that I wanted to have also the gem part of my project. And last and not less how to start to build the project. Once I had my project environment ready to go I started writing code and testing it with puts and pry. I realized later that I could have used the bundle console for my testing but it was too late. 
I needed a lot of time reading, watching lectures, re-reading, re-watching lectures and writing notes to get a proper start. And after finishing it I think I will re-read and re-watch again. Putting everything together has not been easy but it helped a lot in understanding how things work.
I have developed the gem best_reads for the CLI Data Gem Project. My best_reads gem scrapes information about books, like ratings and lists, from the page goodreads.com and shows a menu with ranking lists of books that the user can choose from. Once the user makes his choice a list of the best books will be displayed. It could have been fun to scrape some pages like amazon, Barnes and Noble or Bookdepository and have compared the prices. But that will be in another time.
